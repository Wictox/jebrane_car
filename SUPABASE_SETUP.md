# Supabase Setup Guide

## 1. Get your Credentials
You have already created the project. Now you need the **Anon Public Key**.
1. Go to your Supabase Project Dashboard.
2. Click on **Project Settings** (gear icon) -> **API**.
3. Look for the `anon` `public` key.
4. Copy it.

## 2. Configure Environment
1. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (next to `package.json`).
2. Add the following lines (replace `YOUR_ANON_KEY` with the key you copied):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://oomdkymnhsncregoucxc.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

## 3. Create the Database Table
1. Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase Dashboard (icon with `<_>`).
2. Click **New Query**.
3. Paste the following SQL code and click **Run**:

```sql
create table bookings (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  customer_name text not null,
  phone text not null,
  email text,
  car_model text not null,
  start_date date not null,
  duration integer not null,
  total_price numeric not null,
  status text default 'pending'
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) is recommended but for simplicity we will allow public insert for now
-- In a real app, you would restrict this more.
alter table bookings enable row level security;

-- Allow anyone to insert (create a booking)
create policy "Enable insert for everyone" on bookings for insert with check (true);

-- Allow anyone to read (for the admin dashboard - in a real app this would be authenticated)
create policy "Enable read for everyone" on bookings for select using (true);
```

4. That's it! Your database is ready.
